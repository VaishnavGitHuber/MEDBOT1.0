# 🩺 Medical Report Chatbot

An **AI-powered chatbot** that can read medical PDF reports and answer questions based on their content.  
Built using **Streamlit**, **ChromaDB**, **SentenceTransformers**, and **LLaMA 3** running locally via **Ollama**.

> "AI that reads your reports and answers like a medical assistant."

## 🧠 How It Works

1. 📄 **Upload** a medical report PDF.
2. 🧾 **Text is extracted** from the PDF.
3. 🔍 **Text is chunked and embedded** using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.
4. 🧠 **Query is embedded** and relevant chunks are retrieved from `ChromaDB`.
5. 🤖 **LLaMA 3 via Ollama** generates the final answer based on the context and your question.
